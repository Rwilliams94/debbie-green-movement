      <h1>(Avocational) Photographer</h1>
      <p>
        I have photographed with an Olympus OM1 & OM2 film camera for over 40
        years. My 9-year project of taking photographs of each and every dog
        walk I went on until my dog died in 2015, remains the inspiration for my
        following years of Walks without a Dog.
      </p>
      <p>
        I now photograph with my Olympus OM2 and long lens on both walks and cycle rides. My
        landscapes reflect how I see the world that day with my eye for form and movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, my work has been published by London Independent
        Photographyâ€™s fLIP magazine including for their 50th edition, Winter
        2021, and exhibited at their annual print exhibitions, as well as for
        recent Shutterhub print exhibitions.
