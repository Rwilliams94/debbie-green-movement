            I am a creative who works well with others. I have an experienced and
            critical eye for movement as well as connection with silence, sound and
            music having worked within a professional capacity both as a dancer and
            choreographer. I have spent the last thirty years as teacher of Actor
            Movement at Royal Central School of Speech & Drama, including
            co-authoring <i>Actor Movement: Expression of the Physical Being</i>,
            Bloomsbury, 2015.
